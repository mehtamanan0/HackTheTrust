# HackTheTrust

### Welcome to Hack The Trust 2018! 

###### Thanks so much for participating in Oracle's first 24 hour charity hack in partnership with The Prince's Trust! Within this repo is all you'll need to access the data provided by The Prince's Trust reflecting their demographic. Using their data sample, alongside open source training sets, government data and other open source demographic data, you'll be processing and analysing the results over the weekend to tackle the challenges faced by The Prince's Trust, to help them in their future campaigns.

## üîü The Data

###### The dataset consists of various different social and professional skills young people within the age range of 11-30 strive to develop, including statistics and external data sources that you will have available in order to tackle a host of challenges. You will be able to analyse the data in your own creative & innovative ways.

###### You are welcome to use any open source data sets, ML algorithms or any other resources/scripts you may have. We also encourage you to bring any technologies/ IoT devices (Raspberry Pi‚Äôs etc.) that you would like to use on the day.

## üîë SSH

###### Throughout the hackathon, we are providing you access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure bare metal services where you can run any machine learning or data processing scripts you like! When you registered your team on our webpage, you will have been provided with SSH credentials to login to our servers.

##### SSH Using Windows:
###### On Windows systems, we recommend using WinSCP or PUTTY to SSH into our server. Install and open up WinSCP or PUTTY and type in the following:

```
host name: IP allocated to your team
port: 22
username: opc
no password required
```
###### Click on Advanced options and Authentication under SSH, click on Browse to attached the id_rsa_prince_trust_putty.ppk file. You can now either open up the terminal and start using the command line, or you can copy across any files using drag and drop (WinSCP).

##### SSH Using Mac or Linux:
###### To SSH using unix-like systems, open up the terminal and use the following command with your team's credentials
```
ssh -i <path to id_rsa_prince_trust.dat file> opc@130.61.XX.XXX
```

## üíª IP

###### The IP of the solutions created during the hackathon will reside with the individual/team that created them, such that if they choose to continue developing and coding their project at home they can do so. If at the end of the Hackathon, The Prince's Trust feel as though a team have produced a solution that may be valuable to them in their ongoing campaigns, they may approach that team/individual to progress further and work with them.

###### On the event day webpage you can see the agenda for the weekend, meet the hack team, see photos from the event and much more!

## üìê Open Source Data

###### When analysing the data catalogue provided by The Prince's Trust, you will need a training data set in order to build your portfolio and obtain a more in-depth insight into the demographic's behaviour. So, here are a few links to find some open-source data sets to use in your ML scripts.

## üíª Submitting your solution

###### In order for your team's solution to be judged, you must submit your demo or solution to Oracle's OCI Server. Using your team's credentials allocated to you, login to OCI either using WinSCP, PUTTY or the terminal and copy across your solution into your team's directory.

## üòä Good luck!
