# HackTheTrust

## Welcome to Hack The Trust 2018! 

#### Thanks so much for participating in Oracle's first 24 hour charity hack in partnership with The Prince's Trust! Within this repo is all you'll need to access the data provided by The Prince's Trust reflecting their demographic. Using their data sample, alongside open source training sets, government data and other open source demographic data, you'll be processing and analysing the results over the weekend to tackle the challenges faced by The Prince's Trust, to help them in their future campaigns.

## The Data:

### The dataset consists of various different social and professional skills young people within the age range of 11-30 strive to develop, including statistics and external data sources that you will have available in order to tackle a host of challenges. You will be able to analyse the data in your own creative & innovative ways.

### You are welcome to use any open source data sets, ML algorithms or any other resources/scripts you may have. We also encourage you to bring any technologies/ IoT devices (Raspberry Pi’s etc.) that you would like to use on the day.


## IP:

### The IP of the solutions created during the hackathon will reside with the individual/team that created them, such that if they choose to continue developing and coding their project at home they can do so. If at the end of the Hackathon, The Prince's Trust feel as though a team have produced a solution that may be valuable to them in their ongoing campaigns, they may approach that team/individual to progress further and work with them.

## The Prince's Trust:

### The Prince's Trust is a youth charity that helps young people aged 11 to 30 get into jobs, education and training. All funds raised throughout the Hackathon event will go to help fund the inspirational work that the Prince’s Trust do.
